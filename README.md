# BAG3++

BAG3++ is an open-source analog mixed-signal (AMS) circuit generator framework. It is a fork and successor of the [BAG2 framework](https://github.com/ucb-art/BAG_framework) and the [BAG3 framework](https://github.com/bluecheetah/bag). It enables highly parameterizable generation of tapeout-ready circuit netlists and layout, including automation of simulation with post-processing, physical verification and extraction, and design automation and optimization.
